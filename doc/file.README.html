</ol>

<h2 id="design">Design</h2>

<h3 id="news-default">“News” (default)</h3>

<p><code>/</code> (root – by clicking the HackerNews icon) goes to <code>news#index</code>. So does
<code>news/</code> (clicking the HackerNews title in the nav). This controller makes a HN
API request to get 30 posts from a given slice of <code>:top_stories</code> (the slice is
determined by the <code>params[:p]</code> value) and sets up the model. This displays the
view of the same name. This view, <code>views/news/index.html.erb</code>, displays three
partials: <code>shared/nav</code>, <code>shared/hn_index_items</code>, and <code>shared/footer</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>shared/nav</code> partial utilizes several other partials from <code>shared/util</code> and
<code>shared/nav/</code>. The way the main <code>nav</code> partial works is it renders the links and
colorizes the link that corresponds to the controller that has been called to
render this partial. This approach probably isn’t ideal, but does save from
having a bunch of conditionals in the partial and allows me to keep the shared
partials pretty small. If I condense my controllers in the future, I will need
to refactor the way this <code>nav</code> setup works.</p>

<p>Clicking the comments link in a particular item in the index view links to
<code>/item?id=xxxxxxx</code>, which routes to <code>news#show</code>. This renders the partials
<code>shared/nav</code>, <code>shared/algolia_show_item</code> (with the clicked item passed as a
local variable), and finally <code>shared/algolia_show_items</code>, which calls itself
recursively to display the comment tree (themselves items). The
<code>algolia_show_items</code> partial is called in a <code>each_with_index</code> block, iterating
over the children items of the top-level item – the item that was clicked on
from the index view. The <code>algolia_show_items</code> partial expects three local
variables: <code>item</code> (which is set to the child passed to the block), <code>next_item</code>,
and <code>prev_item</code>.</p>

<h3 id="new">“New”</h3>

<p><code>/newest</code> (“new” in the nav bar) is routed to <code>new#index</code>. This controller makes
a HN API request to get 30 posts from a given slice of <code>:new_stories</code>, and sets
up the model. It renders the <code>new/index</code> view. This view renders three partials:
<code>shared/nav</code>, <code>shared/hn_index_items</code>, and <code>shared/footer</code>, which are identical
to the aforementioned “News” partials.</p>

<h3 id="past">“Past”</h3>

<p>Note: param for this controller is <code>params[:day]</code>.</p>

<p><code>/front</code> (“past” in the nav bar) is routed to <code>past#index</code>. This controller
makes a request to Algolia’s <code>search_by_date</code> API endpoint. This endpoint
returns search results (requested via query params that conform to the
<a href="https://hn.algolia.com/api">API</a>’s accepted paremeters), which returns filtered
results sorted by date (most recent first). The API allows users to pass helpful
parameters to manage result pagination, like <code>hitsPerPage</code> and <code>page</code>, which
allows us to request the standard 30 results per page. This makes paginating
results in the front-end very straightforward. To receive the proper set of
stories for a given date selection, we can pass query params to filter based on
<code>created_at_i</code>, which is an integer representing the story’s creation date in
Unix time. Therefore, we can filter with something like</p>

<p><code>ruby
opts = {
  tags: :story,
  numericFilters: "created_at_i&gt;#{created_at_i},created_at_i&lt;#{ends_at_i}",
  hitsPerPage: 30,
  page: @page
}
</code></p>

<p>We can then set up the response as a regular model for consumption in the view.</p>

<p>Note: currently, we define two separate models for the same “kind” of item data
returned from the HackerNews API and the Algolia APIs respectively: <code>Item</code> and
<code>AlgoliaItem</code>. This approach is not ideal and one of the things I would like to
do is create a single model that handles both data structures at the model
layer, so that our views do not need to differentiate between the two in thier
logic.</p>

<p>This controller then renders the <code>past/index</code> view, which in turn renders the
three partials <code>shared/nav</code>, <code>shared/algolia_index_items</code>, and <code>shared/footer</code>.
(Another note: I can probably move the nav and the footer partials to the
application layout, and just explicitly render a different layout for one-off
application views that don’t display these components.) The
<code>algolia_index_items</code> partial, like the <code>hn_index_items</code> partial, expects a
local <code>items</code> to be provided.</p>

<p>The second row of the item in the index displays only the “score string” (e.g.
<code>783 points by username</code>), the time ago string, and then a pipe, and finally the
<code>n comments</code> link (or, ostensibly, the <code>discuss</code> link).</p>

<p>The date is displayed dynamically in the nav bar (e.g. <code>2024-09-28</code>) and there
are control options displayed at the top of the index as follows:</p>

<p>``` text
Stories from September 28, 2024 (UTC)</p>

<p>Go back a <em>day</em>, <em>month</em>, or <em>year</em>. Go forward a <em>day</em>.
```</p>

<h3 id="comments">“Comments”</h3>

<p><code>/newcomments</code> (“comments” in the nav bar) is routed to <code>comments#index</code>.</p>

<p>This view displays an index of 30 comments. This should be captured by hitting
the Algolia <code>search_by_date</code> endpoint, where we filter by the item type
<code>comment</code>.</p>

<p>An individual comment is displayed with the following format (gray first line,
small):</p>

<p>``` text
[triangle] [time ago link] | [parent] | [context] | on: [title of comment’s parent story]</p>

<p>[comment body in black]
```</p>

<p>Hitting the “More” link in the bottom sets a query param <code>next=item_id</code>…</p>

<h4 id="places-where-my-application-differs-from-newsycombinatorcom">Places where my application differs from news.ycombinator.com</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>For unknown reasons, the “More” link at the bottom of an item index is
displayed in gray on some pages and black on others. Instead of keeping
aligned with this, I’m going to just keep all of mine gray.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When logged in to HackerNews, a navigation item called “Threads” appears. My
application can’t support logging in, so this item won’t appear.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="todos">TODOs</h2>

<p>See the project’s ongoing list of TODOs in <a href="TODO.md">TODO.md</a></p>

<h2 id="development-changes">Development Changes</h2>

<p>Note: This subsection should be replaced by the CHANGELOG when I release an
initial version.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>[2024-05-29]</p>

    <p>I added a log WARN message to HackerNews.get if we attempt to access a
resource that returns <code>nil</code> for the response body. This shouldn’t happen, but
it seems like I can’t rely on the response code because even bad item IDs
result in a <code>res.code</code> of 200.</p>

    <p>I also started work on adding a temporary utility script that I’ll use to
populate the DB with a small subset of items, to try to get a feel for how
much data the whole HN dump will consume.
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38861301">This</a> post seems to indicate
that the dataset should be ~5-6GB.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>[2024-06-23 Sun] – [2024-06-25 Tue]</p>

    <p>I’ve decided not to worry about the database stuff yet. I’ve spent too much
time trying to figure out how best to do that, and too little developing. For
now, let’s just make a fresh request for every new resource we need. Later we
can adding caching/DB support to improve things. I’ll leave the DB setup as
is, unused.</p>

    <p>Adding code like the following improved response times considerably:</p>

    <p><code>ruby
items = []
threads = []
ids.each_with_index do |id, i|
  threads &lt;&lt; Thread.new do
    item = HackerNews.get(resource: :item, id:)
    items[i] = item
  end
end
threads.each(&amp;:join)
</code></p>

    <p>Where we went from getting story details for 30 items in about 5-7 seconds to
doing so in about 0.5 - 2 seconds. Adding threads for these requests was a
good choice, it seems. I did attempt to take things a step further in that I
wrote some code to first check if the requested item exists in the local
database (and just return that), and otherwise we can make the request and
then SAVE the item to the DB (whereby passively populating our own database).
However, doing so in the same async manner caused my code to create a large
number of DB actions at once (since initially there are no items in the DB),
overwhelming the thread pool for the database. A solution to this immediate
issue is to increase the pool configuration number. However, I’m not sure if
that’s sufficient. With many concurrent users, this could crash things. I will
either need to create some kind of protection layer around this, or abandon
this idea for now. The latter is what I’m going with for the time being, as I
would like to come back to DB/cache optimization after I get a v0 application
completed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>[2024-06-26 Wed]</p>

    <p>I added the story rank functionality. Now, stories in <code>/news</code> display the
story’s rank from HackerNews’ <code>/topstories</code> resource.</p>

    <p>I also added the <code>More</code> button to load the next set of stories. This works by
incrementing the <code>p</code> query param and making a <code>get</code> request to <code>/news</code>. A
caveat: the resource we rely on only returns the top 500 stories. Page 16 of
this list (in ranges of 30) ends at 480, so loading page 17 would attempt to
load 481 - 510. I should add logic to the controller to truncate the results
if we’re at the end.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>[2024-06-28 Fri]</p>

    <p>I added the ability to view the secondary and top-level domain in parenthesis,
like is done on HackerNews. However, it is currently just informational. On
the actual website, it appears that this text is a hyperlink to a resource
called <code>/from?site=...</code>, where the user is then directed to a list of all
posts that reference that particular domain. I will need to figure out if
doing this is possible and easy-enough.</p>

    <p>I also added the first piece of the secondary row of information about a
particular story: the points, user, and story age description (e.g. <code>66 points
by todsacerdoti 4 months ago</code>).</p>

    <p>I still need to implement the <code>hide</code> link, which apparently makes a request to
<code>/hide</code> which I <em>think</em> is an alias for <code>/snip-story</code>?</p>

    <p><code>text

    <p>Work on <code>/news</code> view. Mostly styling work. Lots of tailwind trial and error.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>[2024-07-14 Sun]</p>

    <p>Work on <code>/new</code> (renamed the url resource to “/newest”, to reflect HN).
Refactored to allow use of <code>items</code> partial for rendering a list of stories.
Some other styling touch-ups.</p>

    <p>Start work on <code>/from</code>, which is reached by clicking the <code>past</code> link in the nav
menu. Need to figure out how to create that list of stories.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>[2024-08-21 Wed]</p>

    <p>I’ve added a lot in this round of code changes. Too much to really document
without spending a lot of time doing so. Iirc, most of the changes were
related to getting some kind of views for all the navigation headers, and then
a lot went into figuring out how to create the comment hierarchy for a given
story.</p>

    <p>Something I’ve noticed is that when I render the HTML given to us by HN API
for a comment Item, Tailwindcss is styling the HTML elements we render with
the preflight configs. This breaks the styling in a variety of ways.
Unfortunately, we still want the styling we’ve manually applied, but not the
preflights. I haven’t found an easy way to remedy this, so this item should be
a TODO for down the line.</p>

    <p>Another issue is load times for large (&gt; ~ 30 total) comment trees is pretty
abysmal. This is due to the fact that I am making a new request for each level
in a hierarchy. We are still taking advantage of threading all the “kids” of a
particular item (using <code>ApplicationController::get_items_from_ids</code>), but each
level of comments still has to wait on the previous. For large comment trees,
this is <em>slow</em>. Without using a database, I am not sure how resolve this
issue.</p>

    <p>I have a massive amount of <code># TODO</code> comments in the code. Eventually I’ll need
to address them. I also need to refactor a <em>lot</em>. For example, I’ve made it so
the <code>views/shared/_items</code> partial has a ton of <code>if</code> blocks to determine small
styling details based on whether it’s rendered in the main list of Items or a
detail view of an item (with comments).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>[2024-09-12]</p>

    <p>I have made a lot of updates to this application, and have in some ways gotten
nowhere. I had things in an ok state, using the HN API and just loading each
story/comments by making a lot of network requests. Then, I got a new laptop
with a good amount of free space, so I explored supporting a passively
populated DB. Subsequently, I realized there was no way to get newly added
comments to a story without re-requesting all of the children items in the
Item’s list (the HN API provides no way to find updated items, without
constantly monitoring an opaque <code>/updates</code> endpoint). Doing so would render DB
usage kind of pointless, as there would be no performance gain from only
having to query the local DB as opposed to making new network requests.
Moreover, I spent some time refactoring the primary controller
(<code>ItemsController</code>) and related views in a more Rails-conventional manner. All
of these changes currently exist in the now-abandoned
<a href="https://github.com/c-elliott96/hackernews/tree/consolidate_controllers"><code>consolidate_controllers</code></a>
branch, for reference. I am introducing <em>this</em> update in the new
<code>use-algolia-api</code> branch. I should be able to use the changes to views and
controllers as a good reference, after I update the <code>hacker_news</code> service
module to target the Algolia API instead. Finally, I’ll need to rip out the
database configurations in both Rails and the Docker set up, as it is not
necessary and wouldn’t be worth while to keep around. I can easily enough add
it later if I want to.</p>

    <p>I have also moved my TODOs to <a href="TODO.md">TODO.md</a>, to clean up this file. In
doing so, I’ve been able to clean up the TODOs themselves.</p>
