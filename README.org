* What is this project?
Pulls data from Y Combinator's HackerNews public API

This project is designed to be a fully-deployed, fully-featured application made
with Ruby on Rails, vanilla CSS, ReactJS, and Docker for containerization.
Ideally, I investigate every feature of each element of my stack and see if I
can find a way to use it. This is an unrealistic goal, but perhaps the ideal
one.
* What is it made of?
Rails, React, Docker, CSS, one or many databases (TBD),
* What does it do?
Provides an alternative UI to HackerNews, for funsies
* TODO [1/4] Project Roadmap
** DONE [2/2] Get project bootstrapped
:COMPLETED: [2024-03-04 Mon]
- [X] Set up Docker
- [X] Run =bundle install= and save Gemfile.lock. Once we have something in the
  Gemfile, run docker build. Then you can run something like =docker compose run
  --build --rm -v "$PWD":/app -w /app app bundle install=.
** TODO [#A] [0/1] Initial Rails in Docker set up, +javascript, +tests, +styling
*** TODO [0/5] Run =rails new= with whatever flags I think will be suitable
This decision is important.
**** TODO JavaScript
**** TODO Template
[[https://rubydoc.info/gems/slim/file/README.md][slim]] seems like a resonable choice, for no real good reason.
**** TODO Styling
Vanilla CSS, or package congolmerate? For the sake of learning, probably should
use vanilla CSS. Kill me.
**** TODO Tests
**** TODO Anything else?
*** TODO Linter
**** [[https://rubocop.org/][rubocop]] for Ruby
**** [[https://eslint.org/][eslint]] for JS/React
**** [[slim-lint][slim-lint]] for linting slim files
*** TODO Tests
rspec unit tests for back end; capybara tests too?
*** TODO Database(s)
I don't yet know where a DB will be used in my application, but I'll likely need
it. Figure out what needs to be done to secure data at rest and in transport
*** TODO Decide on logger
** TODO [0/4] Deployment --  configuration and redundancy
It's docker. How's the image deployed?
*** TODO Test Suite(s)
*** TODO Deployment
*** TODO Networking
*** TODO Pipeline
** TODO [#B] Design Features
TODO. Make use of Rails, React features for practice
